# Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, please stick to the following guidelines. Thank you for your work!

In all contributions, please stick to the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be aware that your contribution will be published under [the projects license](./LICENSE.md).

## Working with issues

Wether you want to tackle an already existing issue or bring you own one, we recommend to explain your suggested solution in the issue discussion, before beginning implementation. Issues which we think are good for newcomers are flagged as [good first issue](https://github.com/DeutscheModelUnitedNations/munify/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and provide a good entry into contributing to munify.

## Working with branches

Github allows for easy branch creation from an issue. We recommend to do so. We require you to develop on a branch and later create a pull request which will then get reviewed and eventually merged into the main branch. Since code reviews take up a lot of time, please be patient and try to commit well documented and clearly structured code. The best documentation is always the one explaining the *why*.

## Commit messages

We try to stick as close to the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) as possible:

- `feat:` a new feature
- `fix:` a bugfix
- `wip:` work in progress
- `docs:` a documentation update
- `test:` a test update
- `chore:` project housekeeping
- `refactor:` refactor of the code without change in functionality

Below are examples of well-formatted commits:

```

```
